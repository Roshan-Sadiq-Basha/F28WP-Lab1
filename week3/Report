It was not to haard to implement the slideshow.
a unseen challenge was making it so that if it reached the end of the slideshow it would loop back.
i had a bug where if it reached the last image it would just stop working.
After asking a TA they said that it was because the cursor vairable i had was going beyond the list length and crashed.
After figuring this out it was a east fix of 2 if statments that accounted for the ends of the array
